every user has attached policies and inline policies
the attached policies has ARNS the inline policies are just named json
the attached policies can be attached directly or by group
we want each user to have only policies attached by group
it is ok to make up groups just for one user to accomplish this
we wan't to make sure all user policies are in the assigned group before removing them
